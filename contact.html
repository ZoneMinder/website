<h1>Contact ZoneMinder</h1>

<p>ZoneMinder is a free, open source program which is maintained by a very small group of developers, for free, in their spare time.  As such, we <strong>can not and do not offer free technical support / general help.</strong></p>

	<p>For <strong>general help</strong>, including help with installation, troubleshooting cameras or motion detection, and other user-facing issues, please see our <a href="https://forums.zoneminder.com">Forums</a> or <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=zoneminder">IRC Channel</a>.</p>
	<p>For <strong>developer support</strong>, including bug reports, problems with our code, and other software issues, please create a <a href="https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/issues/">GitHub Issue</a>.</p>

	<h2>Paid Support</h2>
	<p>ZoneMinder offers paid support at an hourly rate of $100 USD; you can save 10% by purchasing a 10-hour block of support.  Hourly support is great for assistance with initial setup of your system, fine-tuning of motion detection zones, and troubleshooting pesky cameras that are not working quite right.</p>
      
	<p>As not all work makes sense to be performed in an hourly fashion, we also offer contact-based consulting work for larger projects, such as custom UI development or backend feature work.</p>
       
	<p>Please click the chat icon in the bottom-right of the screen to chat with us live, and be sure to leave an email address.</p>
